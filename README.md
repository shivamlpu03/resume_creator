For implementing this solution, you would typically use code to handle the extraction and formatting. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a direct GitHub link, but hereâ€™s a brief overview of how you can create a solution for this task:

## Set up an API Key:

Obtain an API key from OpenAI.

## Write a Script:

Use a programming language like Python to interact with the OpenAI API.

## Test and Adjust:

Test the script with different resumes and adjust the prompt as needed to handle variations in resume formatting.
